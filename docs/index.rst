simqso
======

Welcome to the simqso documentation! simqso is a set of tools for generating 
mock quasar spectra and photometry. Simulated quasar spectra are built from
a series of components. Common quasar models are built-in, such as a broken
power-law continuum model and Gaussian emission line templates; however, the 
code allows user-defined features to be included. Mock spectra are generated
at arbitrary resolution and can be used to produce broadband photometry
representative of a number of surveys.

simqso consists of the following modules:
